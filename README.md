# Loki Color


A Visual Studio Code theme for the Loki Color is here. I like Tom Hiddleston's clothing color matching (Gold & Dark Green) in the TV show Loki. I also love the various green colors in the Starbucks brand colors. So I created this theme for my VS Code theme.

If you also like green and gold, please install this theme. I hope you like it.
